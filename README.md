# xDuinoRail-Decoder

## Features
This Arduino shield is form easy decoder prototyping plattfrom for Arduino (UNO R3) formfactor MCU boards:

Power:
- It extracts power from the rails.

Data
- It extracts DCC raw signals  from the rails.
- It provides raw (RailCom) feedback to the rails.

The data pins are X (input) and Y (output) per default (no soldering needed, but can be reassigned to any other GPIO-Pins.

## Excluded by purpose
- It doesn't include any power IO
- It doesn't include any MCU
